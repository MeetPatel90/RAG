Streamlit link for RAG: https://zcyhtijbzmyrcxpyxwaxbn.streamlit.app

This is a simplest RAG over pdf/text for Question-Answer. Aim of the project is to show how RAG works under the hood. The demonstration shows how chunking is working, what text chunks are being created then how similarity is being calculated. The demonstration also shows top chunks with highest similarity to the question/prompt. The impletation also shows that if the LLM does not have context then it will say so instead of hullucinating.
